# Food-Prices-In-Zambian-Markets-Data-Analysis-using-SQL

Project Approach
The essence of this data analysis project was to look at the different food prices which were sold in selected Zambian markets. The food prices data covers foods such as maize, rice, beans, sorghum, etc. The food prices are based on the trading market in which the commodity was sold. The dataset contained data from 15/01/2003 to 15/12/2018. 

For this project, a dataset from the World Food Programme in collaboration with Humanitarian Data Exchange the  was used. The preparation of the data in the csv file was done using Microsoft Excel. Thereafter, the dataset was imported into MySQL Workbench for exploratory data analysis using SQL. Finally, visualizations of the analyzed data were created using Tableau.
